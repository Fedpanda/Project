Project Title: Predicting Short-Term Market Reactions to Trump’s Social-Media Posts
The aim of this project is to build and compare machine-learning models that predict short-term market reactions following Donald Trump’s social media posts. The prediction target will be defined specifically — for example, whether the S&P 500 exhibits a positive or negative return in the 1-hour window after a post published during market hours.
To model the textual information, I will extract features such as:

    sentiment scores (e.g., VADER)
    simple topic indicators (policy-related vs. personal content)
    transformer-based embeddings (from a pretrained Hugging Face model)

I will compare multiple supervised learning methods, starting with logistic regression as a baseline and extending to models such as Random Forest and XGBoost. . If possible, I will also compare predictions across platforms (Twitter 2017–2021 vs. Truth Social 2022–present) and keeping in mind his position as appointed president vs private citizen to examine differences in predictive patterns over time and political contexts.

This has however been modified slightly into the final form.
