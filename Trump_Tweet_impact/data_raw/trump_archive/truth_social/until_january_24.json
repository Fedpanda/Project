If I did not do this, I would have been in violation of my Oath of Office, and the Take Care Clause, which requires the President to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Therefore I am entitled to Total Immunity, because that is exactly what I was doing, Taking Care of our Country, and Guarding it from Rigged and Stolen Elections.

There were no defaults, discounts, or anything other than profits for the bank. “THEY WERE TWO PERFECT LOANS,” and the bank in question testified that the loans were great, and FAR SMALLER THAN THE FINE.

I have to look that up.<br/> <br/>Q: Is anyone else paying your legal fees, Ms. Carroll?<br/> <br/>A: No.<br/> <br/>As the trial approached, Kaplan, Carroll’s lawyer, wrote to the Trump legal team to admit that what Carroll said was not true.”</p>"},{"date":1706157312514,"favorites":5577,"id":"111814725629721719","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1713,"text":"<p>Breitbart: “‘Reid Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and a harsh critic of former President Donald J.

He was a “bully” who demanded two trials, rather than one, denied me Due Process, would not allow me to put forth vital evidence (of which there was much!), and only allowed me to be on the witness stand for minutes, telling my lawyer what to ask, and telling me to only give one word answers, as his wife and friends sat in cordoned off front row seats watching with glee. This entire HOAX is a disgrace to our American System of Justice. Any lawyer who takes a TRUMP CASE is either “CRAZY,” or a TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOT. I will make my decision soon!</p>"},{"date":1706674289819,"favorites":12504,"id":"111848606257832461","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3115,"text":"<p>SAVE JUSTICE IN AMERICA!!!</p>"},{"date":1706675375275,"favorites":10458,"id":"111848677394134404","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2272,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1706675812614,"favorites":15606,"id":"111848706056291026","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3071,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1706675819959,"favorites":16984,"id":"111848706537433833","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3722,"text":"<p></p>"},{"date":1706676172815,"favorites":8306,"id":"111848729661903123","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2192,"text":"<p><a href=\"https://links.truthsocial.com/link/111830484360663637\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">breitbart.com/politics/2024/01</span><span class=\"invisible\">/27/exclusive-sebastian-gorka-exposes-lawfare-being-weaponized-against-trump-we-need-president-trump-back/</span></a></p>"},{"date":1706676476742,"favorites":8723,"id":"111848749580440904","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2880,"text":"<p>Not good! <a href=\"https://links.truthsocial.com/link/111833862136251502\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">breitbart.com/europe/2024/01/2</span><span class=\"invisible\">8/ukrainian-defence-officials-charged-with-stealing-40-million-from-weapons-budget/</span></a></p>"},{"date":1706676495021,"favorites":12751,"id":"111848750778601527","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3664,"text":"<p>He is by far the most Radical Left person running for office, maybe ever!
