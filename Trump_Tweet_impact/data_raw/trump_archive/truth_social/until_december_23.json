Therefore, on that fact alone, this Fake Case should be dismissed. Additionally, however, the Financial Statements Values are Conservative (LOW!), Mar-a-Lago is worth MUCH MORE than $18,000,000, there is a 100% Disclaimer Clause on the 1st page of the Statements, the Banks and Insurance Companies were paid in full, no defaults, they all made money, and there is no Victim (except me!).

He fought us, sanctioned us for no reason, fined us big money, never gave us even a one day delay. This is his big chance, and he was not going to let it go. In the meantime, they “lost” their Star Witness, and my Financial Statements are GREAT! There was no fraud, so they are working with the corrupt A.G. whose campaign was “I will get Trump,” to develop something, anything. They even go back to 2014, past the Statute of Limitations, to look at a “low ball” offer I made for the Buffalo Bills. Someone else offered much more, so what?

The State won 100% of their motions, including the fastest trial date for such a case in memory, “with no extensions for anything.” I’m being “railroaded” at a level never seen before. When Cohen admitted the whole case was a lie, he didn’t care. Think of it, we had a Perry Mason moment with their Star Witness and the judge acted like nothing had happened, and then started screaming at us. He then put a RIDICULOUS GAG ORDER ON ME, which we will appeal. He fines me at levels never seen before. The A.G.’s people are thrilled, but can’t believe it is happening.

A truly beautiful woman, tall and elegant, with a presence like no other, she was also a tremendous student, intellect, and Judge, in charge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, just below the U.S. Supreme Court. Her life was largely problem free, PERFECT, until I made it difficult for her when I decided to run for President. The Fake News, and others, went after her mercilessly, and because of the fact that she felt it inappropriate, due to her position, to defend herself, it just never stopped! While tough and strong, she was made to suffer in those years from 2016 until her Retirement. I will never forget the many times people would come up to me and say,“Your sister was the smartest person on the Court.” I was always honored by that, but understood exactly what they meant—They were right! She was a great Judge, and a great sister.

Recall that James campaigned on targeting Trump. She said that going after him was her primary motivation to run for office and that she’s got her ‘eyes on Trump Tower.’ Attorney General James’ case doesn’t even have a victim.

Bernie will always stand up to the Fascist “nut jobs” and the spineless RINOS in order to fight the corrupt Deep State that is destroying our Country. Remember, we need a successful political outsider like Bernie to defeat Liberal career politician, Sherrod Brown, who has so poorly represented Ohio, and pretends that he’s all for the Policies of your Favorite President, Donald J. Trump, but then gets to the Senate and votes 100% for the horrendous Policies of Crooked Joe Biden, the worst President in the History of our Country. Don’t be fooled by Sherrod Brown. He is a Radical Left Liberal who will always let you down. He does not stand for Ohio Values, and never will. Bernie Moreno, on the other hand, will ALWAYS put America First.</p>"},{"date":1703025365825,"favorites":5885,"id":"111609470372314584","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1608,"text":"<p>Text TRUMP to 88022</p>"},{"date":1703025439524,"favorites":7696,"id":"111609475202176845","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2051,"text":"<p>MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! <a href=\"https://links.truthsocial.com/link/110114375514387839\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://www.</span><span class=\"\">donaldjtrump.com/</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span></a></p>"},{"date":1703025825454,"favorites":8985,"id":"111609500492283499","isRetweet":false,"retweets":2330,"text":"<p>THANK YOU—MAGA!!!<br/><a href=\"https://links.truthsocial.com/link/110363224791687616\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"\">ia.donaldjtrump.com/</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span></a></p>"},{"date":1703028465375,"favorites":4738,"id":"111609673502051903","isRetweet":false,"retweets":1411,"text":"<p><a href=\"https://links.truthsocial.com/link/111601498198347167\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"ellipsis\">thefederalist.com/2023/12/18/m</span><span class=\"invisible\">eet-lawyer-michael-dreeben-the-man-behind-three-major-anti-trump-operations/</span></a></p>"},{"date":1703028490993,"favorites":10172,"id":"111609675180786484","isRetweet":false,"retweets":3326,"text":"<p><span class=\"quote-inline\"><br/>RT: https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/111609673502051903</span>So, now we have reached a point when a President of the United States has WEAPONIZED the Department of Justice as though we were a Third World Country.
